Description:
	This is a project that integrates behaviour trees with a traiditional street fighter game clone.
	The AI can do basic moveset of kicking, puching, crouchpunch and crouchkick.
	The AI is fed users current moveset and is made to make moves to counter the player.
	It also uses a chance function to create variety in what the AI will do,
	It is integrated in AI.gd script so feel free to make adjustments to your likings, the chance function.
	For player i have integrated a basic state machine.
	It also has a win-lose condition when the players health or the AI's health become zero.
